academic,The Relation Between Academic Freedom and Free Speech,Forthcoming in Ethics,"The standard view of the relation between academic freedom and free speech is that they serve complementary ends in higher education. The university should play host to academic dis-course and to other kinds of public discourse, and where the former should be protected by academic freedom, the latter should be protected by principles of free speech. My aim in this paper is to challenge this prima facie attractive picture of the university. The key worry is that a campus free speech culture can subvert the realisation of the university's intellectual mission. How might one defend the standard view in the face of this worry? I consider two types of posi-tive arguments that have been offered on behalf of the standard view. One says that a campus free speech culture in fact makes an important contribution to the realisation of the universi-ty's intellectual mission. The other type of argument says that the university has a role to play in nurturing a democratic ethos, and that this requires a special commitment to free speech. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments.",,,
academic,The Conversational Character of Oppression,Forthcoming in Australasian Philosophical Review,"Mary Kate McGowan argues that everyday verbal bigotry makes a key contribution to the harms of discriminatory inequality, via a mechanism that she calls sneaky norm enactment. Part of her account involves showing that the characteristic of conversational interaction that facilitates sneaky norm enactment is in fact a generic one, which obtains in a wide range of activities – namely, the property of having conventions of appropriateness. I argue that her account will be better-able to show that everyday verbal bigotry is a key factor in social inequality if it tries to isolate a more specific property of conversation as the thing that facilitates sneaky norm enactment.

Hate Speech, Harm, and Childhood",Law and Philosophy 38/1 (2019): 79-108,"Some authors claim that hate speech plays a key role in perpetuating unjust social hierarchy. One prima facie plausible hypothesis about how this occurs is that hate speech has a pernicious influence on the attitudes of children. Here I argue that this hypothesis has an important part to play in the formulation of an especially robust case for general legal prohibitions on hate speech. If our account of the mechanism via which hate speech effects its harms is built around claims about hate speech’s influence on children, then we will be better-placed to acquire evidence that demonstrates the processes posited in our account, and better-placed to ascribe responsibility for these harms to individuals who engage in hate speech. I briefly suggest some policy implications that come with developing an account of the harm of hate speech along these lines.",Think-of-the-Children.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10982-018-9339-3,Journal Link
academic,Language and Legitimation,"Forthcoming in Rachel Sterken and Justin Khoo (Eds.), The Routledge Handbook of Social and Political Philosophy of Language (London: Routledge)","The verb ‘to legitimate’ is often used in political discourse in a way that’s prima facie perplexing. To wit, it is often said that an actor legitimates a practice that is formally proscribed in the relevant context, e.g. that a worker telling sexist jokes legitimates sexual discrimination in the workplace. In order to clarify the meaning of statements like this, and show how they can sometimes be true and informative, we need an account of how something which is formally illegitimate can have a kind of ersatz legitimacy conferred on it, and how this can occur even when the actor ‘doing the legitimating’ lacks formal authority. I examine an account of this sort which makes reference to the phenomenon of ‘normalization’, and highlight some advantages that this account has in comparison an alternative account, which makes reference to the phenomenon of ‘licensed authority’.",Language-Legitimation.pdf,,
academic,No Platforming,"In Jennifer Lackey (Ed.), Academic Freedom (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018): 186-209 (with Amia Srinivasan).","This paper explains how the practice of ‘no platforming’ can be reconciled with a liberal politics. While opponents say that no platforming flouts ideals of open public discourse, and defenders see it as a justifiable harm-prevention measure, both sides mistakenly treat the debate like a run-of-the-mill free speech conflict, rather than an issue of academic freedom specifically. Content-based restrictions on speech in universities are ubiquitous. And this is no affront to a liberal conception of academic freedom, whose purpose isn’t just to protect the speech of academics, but also to give them the prerogative to determine which views and speakers have sufficient disciplinary credentials to receive a hearing in academic contexts. No platforming should therefore be acceptable to liberals, in principle, in cases where it is used to support a university culture that maintains rigorous disciplinary standards, by denying attention and credibility to speakers without appropriate disciplinary credentials.",No-Platforming.pdf,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/academic-freedom-9780198791508?cc=gb&lang=en&,Book Link

Feinberg argues that being offended can impair a person’s liberty, much like a nuisance, and that it is therefore legitimate in principle to regulate conduct because of its offensiveness. In this paper I discuss some overlooked considerations that give us reason to resist Feinberg’s conclusion, even while granting this premise. My key claim is that the regulation of offense can inadvertently increase the incidence of offense, by nurturing offense-taking sensibilities. In the course of defending this claim and spelling out its implications, I explain why concerns about the inadvertent nurturing of offense are now more pressing, given the identity-political character of contemporary offense-based social conflicts, and I discuss why a reluctance to legally regulate offensive conduct need not be insensitive to the identity-political issues that animate those conflicts.",Regulating-Offense.pdf,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1470594X17741228,Journal Link

Some critics of this view argue that it condones, as rationally acceptable, sets of attitudes that manifest an untenable kind of arbitrariness. I begin by providing a new and more detailed explication of what this alleged arbitrariness consists in. I then explain why Miriam Schoenfield’s prima facie promising attempt to answer the Arbitrariness Objection, by appealing to the role of epistemic standards in rational belief formation, fails to resolve the problem. Schoenfield’s strategy is, however, a useful one, and I go on to explain how an alternative form of the standards-based approach to Permissivism – one that emphasizes the significance of the relationship between people’s cognitive abilities and the epistemic standards that they employ – can respond to the arbitrariness objection.",Permissivism.pdf,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/permissivism-and-the-arbitrariness-objection/4623130173707A94B11A4AC4103B9C06,Journal Link

Many complaints that have been made about political correctness in the past, we argue, amount to little more than a veiled expression of resentment over the increasing influence enjoyed by progressive activists. But some complaints about political correctness take on a different complexion, in light of the technologically-driven changes to our communicative practices and political discourse. Given the ways in which they are entangled in these new forms of online communication, well-meaning attempts to police the norms of political correctness may end up contributing to individual wrongs, or to destructive social patterns.

Whitney)","This paper investigates whether search engines and other new modes of online communication should be covered by free speech principles. It criticizes the analogical reasoning that contemporary American courts and scholars have used to liken search engines to newspapers, and to extend free speech coverage to them based on that likeness. There are dissimilarities between search engines and newspapers that undermine the key analogy, and also rival analogies that can be drawn which don’t recommend free speech protection for search engines. Partly on these bases, we argue that an analogical approach to questions of free speech coverage is of limited use in this context. Credible verdicts about how free speech principles should apply to new modes of online communication require us to re-excavate the normative foundations of free speech. This method for deciding free speech coverage suggests that only a subset of search engine outputs and similar online communication should receive special protection against government regulation.",Search-Engines.pdf,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/free-speech-in-the-digital-age-9780190883607?cc=gb&lang=en&,Book Link
academic,Reconciling Regulation with Scientific Autonomy in Dual-use Research,Forthcoming in Journal of Medicine and Philosophy (with Nicholas G. Evans and Michael J. Selgelid),"In debates over the regulation of communication related to dual-use research, we have to weigh the risks that such communication creates, against the value of scientific autonomy. The censorship of such communication seems justifiable in certain cases, given the potentially catastrophic applications of some dual-use research. But this conclusion gives rise to another kind of danger: that regulators will use overly simplistic cost-benefit reasoning to rationalise excessive regulation of scientific research. In response to this, we show how institutional design principles and normative frameworks from free speech theory can be used to help extend the argument for regulating dangerous dual-use research beyond overly simplistic cost-benefit reasoning, but without reverting to an implausibly absolutist view of scientific autonomy.",Reconciling-Regulation.pdf,,

Heinze's project is to formulate and defend a more theoretically complex version of the idea (also defended by people like Ronald Dworkin and James Weinstein) that general legal prohibitions on hate speech in public discourse compromises the state's democratic legitimacy. We offer a detailed synopsis of Heinze's view, highlighting some of its distinctive qualities and strengths. We then develop a critical response to this view with three main focal points: (1) the characterisation of democratic legitimacy as something distinct from (and whose demands aren't identical with those of) legitimacy per se; (2) the claim that the requirements of democracy are hypothetical, rather than categorical, imperatives; and relatedly (3) the question of how we should reconcile the requirements of democratic legitimacy with the costs that may follow from prioritising democratic legitimacy.

The significance of such ‘Etiological Challenges’ is a topic that has started attracting attention in epistemology. Current work on this topic aims to show that Etiological Challenges are, at most, only indirectly epistemically significant, insofar as they bring other generic epistemic considerations to the agent’s attention (e.g. disagreement, consistency with one’s own epistemic standards, evidence of one’s fallibility). Against this approach, we argue that Etiological Challenges are epistemically significant in a more direct and more distinctive way. An Etiological Challenge prompts the agent to assess whether her beliefs result from practices of indoctrination, and whether she should reduce confidence in those beliefs, given the anti-reliability of indoctrination as a method of belief-acquisition. Our analysis also draws attention to some of the ways in which epistemic concerns interact with political issues—e.g. relating to epistemic injustice, identity-based discrimination, and segregation—when we’re thinking about the contingent causal origins of our beliefs.",Indoctrination-Anxiety.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-015-0919-6,Journal Link

Conceiving of such reasons as epistemic reasons seems to lead to absurd consequences, for example, allowing that someone can rationally hold beliefs that conflict with her assessment of her evidence's probative force. We explain why conceiving of such reasons as epistemic reasons can avoid this and other intuitively unwelcome results. We also suggest a positive case for conceiving of such reasons as epistemic reasons, namely, that they exhibit a kind of interpersonal normative parity that's typical of epistemic reasons but not pragmatic reasons. We then discuss connections between these issues and religious belief, suggesting that there are sometimes indirect epistemic reasons for religious belief, and that certain characterisations of religious belief may be instructive in thinking about what's involved in taking account of indirect epistemic reasons.",Indirect-Epistemic-Reasons,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/religious-studies/article/indirect-epistemic-reasons-and-religious-belief/01C9F05E73DADA6C2BC62F3C9B595023,Journal Link

I argue that much free speech discourse comes with a tacit commitment to a ‘Subtractive Approach’ to defining speech. As an initial default, all communicative acts are assumed to qualify as speech, before exceptions are made to ‘subtract’ those acts that don’t warrant the special legal protections owed to ‘speech’. I examine how different versions of the Subtractive Approach operate, and criticise them in terms of their ability to yield a substantive definition of speech which covers all and only those forms of communicative action that – so our arguments for free speech indicate – really do merit special legal protection. In exploring alternative definitional approaches, I argue that what ultimately compromises definitional adequacy in this arena is a theoretical commitment to the significance of a single unified class of privileged communicative acts.

Here I examine Murrow and Murrow‘s suggestions about how identity-based hate speech bears responsibility for dehumanization in the first place. I identify a distinction between (i) accounts of the nature of the harm effected by identity prejudice, and (ii) accounts of how hate speech contributes to the harms of identity prejudice. I then explain why Murrow and Murrow‘s proposal is more aptly construed as an account of type (i), and explain why accounts of this type, even if they‘re plausible and evidentially well-supported, have limited implications in relation to justifications for anti-hate speech law.",Dehumanization.pdf,https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/3/1/178/1751232,Journal Link

The reasons for this relate to Paul Kahn’s claims about the paradox of riskless warfare. When an Underdog poses no threat to a Superpower, the standard just war theoretic justifications for the Superpower’s combatants using lethal violence against their opponents breaks down. Therefore, Kahn argues, combatants in that position must approach their opponents in an ethical guise relevantly similar to ‘policing’. I argue that the kind of disparities in risk and threat between opposing combatants that Kahn’s analysis posits, don’t obtain in the context of face-to-face combat, in the way they would need to in order to support his ethical conclusions about policing.

Agar’s argument hinges on the claim that extended lifespans will result in people’s lives being dominated by the fear of death. Here we examine this claim and the surrounding issues in Agar’s discussion. We argue, firstly, that Agar’s view rests on empirically dubious assumptions about human rationality and attitudes to risk, and secondly, that even if those assumptions are granted, the fears that Agar adverts to are unlikely to dominate people’s lives if and when radical life-extension is made possible. Further, we claim that the structure of the decision-making process around life-extension is unlikely to be the way that it would need to be in order for Agar’s claims about fear of death to make sense. Finally, we argue that Agar is implicitly committed to a narrow conception of human value. In response, we suggest that the pursuit of life-extension can itself be seen as an expression of certain important aspects of our distinctively human nature.",Overabundance.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10677-013-9431-6,Journal Link

Riskless warfare creates ethical problems that the superpower state must grapple with, in trying to determine whether and how it can justly engage in military conflicts involving profound military-technological disparities. But riskless warfare isn’t an ethical problem from the point of view of the individual soldier in the superpower’s military, insofar as that soldier’s life remains under threat from opposing soldiers. The significance of enhanced battlesuit technology is that these risks to individual soldiers may become greatly mitigated, or even, in various cases, eliminated, which would in turn problematise the superpower soldier’s justification for attacking the underdog soldier with lethal force, in a way that broadly resembles the ‘paradox of riskless warfare’ that applies at the level of the state.

academic,"Dignity, Harm, and Hate Speech",Law and Philosophy 32/6 (2013): 701-28,"This paper examines two recent contributions to the hate speech literature – by Steven Heyman and Jeremy Waldron – which seek a justification for the legal restriction of hate speech in an account of the way that hate speech infringes against people’s dignity. These analyses look beyond the first-order hurts and disadvantages suffered by the immediate targets of hate speech, and consider the prospect of hate speech sustaining complex social structures whose wide-scale operations lower the social status of members of targeted groups. In Heyman’s and Waldron’s accounts we find plausible insights into the nature of identity-based social hierarchies, and the harms that redound to subordinated people under the operations of such hierarchies. I argue, however, that both analyses are unsuccessful as justifications for the restriction of hate speech, because they do not ultimately provide reason to think that hate speech is responsible for creating or sustaining identity-based social hierarchies.",Dignity-Harm.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10982-012-9164-z,Journal Link
academic,Intellectual Agency and Responsibility for Belief in Free Speech Theory,Legal Theory 19/3 (2013): 307-30,"The idea that human beings are intellectually self-governing plays two roles in free speech theory. Firstly, this idea is frequently called upon as part of the justification for free speech. Secondly, it plays a role in guiding the translation of free speech principles into legal policy, by underwriting the ascriptive framework through which responsibility for certain kinds of speech harms can be ascribed. After mapping out these relations, I then ask what becomes of them once we acknowledge certain general and profound limitations in people’s capacity for intellectual self-governance. I argue that acknowledging these limitations drastically undermines the putative justifications for free speech of the type that I identify in the first part of the paper. I then show how we can reformulate an ‘ascriptive’ account of intellectual and doxastic responsibility, on which we may still be held responsible for what we think or believe, even though we lack agent-causal capacities in our thinking and believing.

academic,Unringing the Bell: McGowan on Oppressive Speech and the Assymetric Pliability of Conversation,Australasian Journal of Philosophy 91/3 (2013): 555-75,"Mary Kate McGowan proposes an account of oppressive speech inspired by Lewis’s analysis of conversational kinematics. Speech can effect identity-based oppression, McGowan argues, by altering the ""conversational score"" – i.e. by introducing presuppositions and expectations into a conversation, and thus determining what sort of subsequent conversational ‘moves’ are felicitous – in a manner that oppresses members of a certain group, e.g. because the suppositions demean that group. In keeping with the Lewisian picture, McGowan notes the asymmetric pliability of conversational scores. For example, it is easier to introduce sexist presuppositions into a conversation, she argues, than it is to remove them. Responding to a sexist remark is thus like trying to ""unring a bell"". After explaining how McGowan's account of oppressive speech improves upon the work of others, in its explication of the relation between speech and structural oppression, I then propose a supportive elaboration of her claims about the asymmetric pliability of conversations involving identity-oppressive speech. We can understand this asymmetry as a consequence of a more general asymmetry between making things salient and un-salient in speech. I also discuss how this asymmetry also operates in various cases that interested Lewis.",Unringing.pdf,https://aap.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00048402.2012.704053,Journal Link

How should we distinguish between the two kinds of cases, and thereby account for our divergent intuitions about how we ought to respond to them? One possibility is to say that ceding ground in a trivial dispute is appropriate because the disputing parties are usually epistemic peers within the relevant domain, whereas in a more substantial disagreement the disputing parties rarely, if ever, qualify as epistemic peers, and so ‘sticking to one’s guns’ is usually the appropriate doxastic response.

other,Silencing Milo: On the Mission and Culture of a University,"Text of a keynote talk given at the University of Tartu, 20th of October 2018, at a Conference on ""The Ethics of Conduct in Debate""","In this talk -- which draws heavily on my article on ""The Relation Between Academic Freedom and Free Speech"" -- I argue that there is a much less strong case for universities providing platforms to trolls and provocateurs, than what is normally claimed by advocates of free speech on campus. The main reason to refrain from platforming such speakers isn't that their speech is harmful or offensive, as proponents of no-platforming often argue, but rather that platforming trolls and provocateurs fails to promote, and in various situations is likely to inhibit or undermine, the achievement of the university's defining intellectual aims.",Silencing-Milo.pdf,,
other,Free Speech is a Blunt Instrument: Let's Break it Up,"Aeon, 31st of March 2017","This piece is a condensed restatement of some of the ideas defended in a more expansive way in my scholarly article on ""Defining Speech"". I argue that there are good grounds for thinking of 'free speech' as a collection of multiple distinct principles of communicative liberty, governing different types of communicative practices, as opposed to a single, unified principle of communicative liberty governing communicative practices in general.",Blunt-Instrument.pdf,https://aeon.co/ideas/free-speech-is-a-blunt-instrument-lets-break-it-up,Web Link
other,Constructive Intrinsic Valuation,Unpublished scholarly article,"In this paper I define and defend a valuing stance that I call Constructive Intrinsic Valuation. In cases of Constructive Intrinsic Valuation it can be appropriate for someone to value x intrinsically, even if x doesn’t possess intrinsic value. I characterize this stance by contrasting it with two more familiar types of appropriate intrinsic valuation: valuing something intrinsically because you recognize an ethical duty to do so, and valuing something intrinsically because you think its value is (in a certain sense) unconnected from anything else. After defending the coherence of Constructive Intrinsic Valuation, I explain its importance. There are things some of us value intrinsically, but that we cannot confidently ascribe intrinsic value to. My account shows how it may still be appropriate to value such things intrinsically even while the uncertainty remains.",Intrinsic-Valuation.pdf,,

other,"Moral Renegades: Review of Strangers Drowning, by Larissa MacFarquhar, and Doing Good Better, by William MacAskill","The New Rambler Review, 12th of July 2016","This piece is a side-by-side review of two books: Strangers Drowning, by Larissa MacFarquhar, and Doing Good Better, by William MacAskill. Both books are concerned with the question of whether we should try to live as morally good a life as possible. MacAskill thinks the answer is 'yes', and his book is an overview of how the Effective Altruist movement approaches the problem of how to achieve a morally optimal life. MacFarquhar's book is a more descriptive account of the lives of people who aim to live in a morally optimal way. Her discussion is nuanced, and somewhat ambivalent about the merits of this aim. My review brings out some commonalities and differences between the two books, and critically digests the arguments on offer.",Moral-Renegades.pdf,https://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/philosophy/moral-renegades,Web Link
other,"White Lies, Right Speech, and Free Speech","Text of a talk prepared for an intercultural workshop on Buddhism in Henan, China, July 2018","This is a short piece, prepared for an intercultural workshop on Buddhism, which I attended while I was a visiting lecturer at a summer school at Wuhan University in 2018. I try to identify points of common ground between the Buddhist doctrine of right speech, and the Western ethical-political ideal of freedom of speech. I suggest that it is possible for freedom of speech to be theorised and understood in a way that isn't just shallowly individualistic, but which, instead, takes free and open communication to be part of a social ethos that ultimately conduces to social harmony and the emancipation of individuals from shallow individualism.",White-Lies.pdf,,
other,The Origin of Belief,"The Forum, 15th of August 2016 (with Joshua DiPaolo); Republished in The Philosophers’ Magazine, Issue 78 (3rd Quarter, 2017) as “The Origins of Our Beliefs”","This piece is a condensed restatement -- coauthored with Josh DiPaolo -- of some of the ideas defended in a more expansive way in our scholarly article on ""Indoctrination Anxiety and the Etiology of Belief"". Our question is how we should understand what's going on, epistemologically speaking, when someone says to another person something like ""you only believe in God because you were raised in a religious household"". Does the drawing of attention to the arbitrary causal origins of some person's beliefs represent a good reason for the person in question to reduce her confidence in the relevant beliefs? Yes, we argue, in those cases where the point of the challenge is to advert to the possibility that the person was indoctrinated into those beliefs.

other,Making Humans Morally Better Won't Fix Climate Change,"JME Blog, 25th of August 2016","This piece is a condensed restatement of some of the ideas defended in a more expansive way in my scholarly article on ""Climate Change, Cooperation, and Moral Bioenhancement"" (co-authored with Pei-hua Huang and Toby Handfield). I explain why the idea of technologically boosting the general public's pro-social dispositions, in the hope of increasing people's willingness to modify their behaviour to reduce their contributions to climate -- a proposal entertained by some advocates of 'moral bioenhancement' -- is unlikely to succeed. It's unlikely to succeed because it's premised on a faulty understanding of how human cooperation works. Human cooperation relies on an equilibrium of pro-social and anti-social dispositions. Simply boosting people's pro-sociality runs the risk of disrupting that equilibrium in a way that in fact makes mass coordainted cooperative behaviour less likely.",,https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2016/08/25/making-humans-morally-better-wont-fix-the-problems-of-climate-change/,Web Link
other,"Prevent Harm, Allow Offence?","The Free Speech Debate, 8th of January 2013","In this short piece I consider what, if anything, differentiates feelings of offense (e.g. caused by mockery of one's values) from psychological harm (e.g. caused by verbal harassment). I suggest that one key difference is to do with the inherently self-conscious character of offense: to be offended is, necessarily, to consciously feel offended. By contrast, one can be psychologically harmed in a way that is not self-consciously registered by the victim. ",,https://freespeechdebate.com/discuss/prevent-harm-allow-offence/,Web Link
