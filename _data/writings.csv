academic,"Minimalism, Determinacy, and Human Rights",Forthcoming in Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence,"Many theorists understand human rights as only aiming to secure a minimally decent existence, rather than a positively good or flourishing life. Some of the theoretical considerations that support this minimalist view have been mapped out in the philosophical literature. The aim of this paper is to explain how a relatively neglected theoretical desideratum – namely, determinacy – can be invoked in arguing for human rights minimalism. Most of us want a theory of human rights whose demands can be realized, and which is acceptable to a range of worldviews. But we might also expect our theory to provide determinate answers to questions of scope (i.e. which putative rights are bona fide human rights?) and practical implementation (i.e. what concrete duties are generated by which rights?). A minimalist view of human rights makes it easier to jointly fulfil all of these desiderata.",Minimalism-Determinacy.pdf,,
academic,The Machine Stops: The Ethics of Quitting Social Media,"Forthcoming in Carissa Véliz (Ed.), Oxford Handbook of Digital Ethics (Oxford: Oxford University Press)","There are prima facie ethical reasons and prudential reasons for people to avoid or withdraw from major social media platforms. But in response to pushes for people to quit social media, a number of authors have argued that there is something ethically questionable about quitting social media: that it involves – typically, if not necessarily – an objectionable expression of privilege on the part of the quitter. In this paper I contextualise privilege-based objections to quitting social media and explain the underlying principles and assumptions that feed into these objections. I show how they misrepresent the kind of act people are performing in quitting, in part by downplaying its role in promoting reforms in communication systems and technologies. And I suggest that this misrepresentation is related to a more widespread, and ultimately insidious, tendency to think of recently-established technological services and practices as permanent fixtures of our society.",Machine-Stops.pdf,,
academic,Epistemic Permissivism and Reasonable Pluralism,"Forthcoming in M. Hannon and J. de Ridder (Eds.), Routledge Handbook of Political Epistemology (London: Routledge) // with Richard Rowland","There is an intuitive difference in how we think about pluralism and attitudinal diversity in epistemological and political contexts. On one hand, it seems problematically arbitrary to hold a particular belief on some issue, while also thinking it perfectly reasonable to hold a totally different belief on the same issue given the same evidence. By contrast, though, it doesn’t seem problematically arbitrary to have a particular set of political commitments, while at the same time thinking it perfectly reasonable for someone in a similar position have a totally different set of political commitments. This chapter examines three explanatory theses that might be used to make sense of this difference: (1) that practical commitments are desire dependent in a way that beliefs are not; (2) that there are reasons to be resolute in practical commitments, but not in beliefs; and (3) that compromise in the face of practical political disagreement doesn’t mitigate controversy, whereas compromise in the face of disagreement about mere beliefs does mitigate controversy.",Permissivism-Pluralism.pdf,,
academic,The Relation Between Academic Freedom and Free Speech,Ethics 130/3 (2020): 287-319,"The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defence of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments.",Academic-Freedom.pdf,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/707211?casa_token=lY8LBZ4eeMYAAAAA%3AtlpznZx49deuXOZjqkZyZx1Xq32GNc6HXnzB-QozO1K3teKTJ2GF_YuGOntzMFA-kFztUHdqHWOY,Journal Link
academic,The Conversational Character of Oppression,Forthcoming in Australasian Philosophical Review,"Mary Kate McGowan argues that everyday verbal bigotry makes a key contribution to the harms of discriminatory inequality, via a mechanism that she calls sneaky norm enactment.

academic,The Big Shill,Forthcoming in Ratio // with Eliot Michaelson,"Shills are people who endorse products and companies for pay, while pretending that their endorsements are ingenuous. Here we argue that there is something objectionable about shilling that is not reducible to its bad consequences, the lack of epistemic conscientiousness it often relies upon, or the shill’s insincerity. Indeed, we take it as a premise of our inquiry that shilling can sometimes be sincere, and that its wrongfulness is not mitigated by the shill’s sincerity, in cases where the shill is sincere. Our proposal is that the shill’s defining characteristic is their knowingly engaging in a kind of speech that obscures a certain aspect of its social status – most commonly, by pretending to speak on their own personal behalf, while in fact speaking as an employee – and that this sort of behaviour is objectionable irrespective of any other features of the shill’s conduct.

Hate Speech, Harm, and Childhood",Law and Philosophy 38/1 (2019): 79-108,"Some authors claim that hate speech plays a key role in perpetuating unjust social hierarchy. One prima facie plausible hypothesis about how this occurs is that hate speech has a pernicious influence on the attitudes of children. Here I argue that this hypothesis has an important part to play in the formulation of an especially robust case for general legal prohibitions on hate speech. If our account of the mechanism via which hate speech effects its harms is built around claims about hate speech’s influence on children, then we will be better-placed to acquire evidence that demonstrates the processes posited in our account, and better-placed to ascribe responsibility for these harms to individuals who engage in hate speech.

academic,Language and Legitimation,"Forthcoming in Rachel Sterken and Justin Khoo (Eds.), The Routledge Handbook of Social and Political Philosophy of Language (London: Routledge)","The verb ‘to legitimate’ is often used in political discourse in a way that’s prima facie perplexing. To wit, it is often said that an actor legitimates a practice that is formally proscribed in the relevant context, e.g. that a worker telling sexist jokes legitimates sexual discrimination in the workplace. In order to clarify the meaning of statements like this, and show how they can sometimes be true and informative, we need an account of how something which is formally illegitimate can have a kind of ersatz legitimacy conferred on it, and how this can occur even when the actor ‘doing the legitimating’ lacks formal authority. I examine an account of this sort which makes reference to the phenomenon of ‘normalization’, and highlight some advantages that this account has in comparison an alternative account, which makes reference to the phenomenon of ‘licensed authority’.",Language-Legitimation.pdf,,
academic,No Platforming,"In Jennifer Lackey (Ed.), Academic Freedom (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018): 186-209 // with Amia Srinivasan","This paper explains how the practice of ‘no platforming’ can be reconciled with a liberal politics. While opponents say that no platforming flouts ideals of open public discourse, and defenders see it as a justifiable harm-prevention measure, both sides mistakenly treat the debate like a run-of-the-mill free speech conflict, rather than an issue of academic freedom specifically. Content-based restrictions on speech in universities are ubiquitous. And this is no affront to a liberal conception of academic freedom, whose purpose isn’t just to protect the speech of academics, but also to give them the prerogative to determine which views and speakers have sufficient disciplinary credentials to receive a hearing in academic contexts. No platforming should therefore be acceptable to liberals, in principle, in cases where it is used to support a university culture that maintains rigorous disciplinary standards, by denying attention and credibility to speakers without appropriate disciplinary credentials.",No-Platforming.pdf,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/academic-freedom-9780198791508?cc=gb&lang=en&,Book Link

Many complaints that have been made about political correctness in the past, we argue, amount to little more than a veiled expression of resentment over the increasing influence enjoyed by progressive activists. But some complaints about political correctness take on a different complexion, in light of the technologically-driven changes to our communicative practices and political discourse. Given the ways in which they are entangled in these new forms of online communication, well-meaning attempts to police the norms of political correctness may end up contributing to individual wrongs, or to destructive social patterns. In this paper we examine these worries, situate them in a broader sociological context, and offer some tentative proposals about how they might be addressed.",Political-Correctness.pdf,https://www.routledge.com/Media-Ethics-Free-Speech-and-the-Requirements-of-Democracy-1st-Edition/Fox-Saunders/p/book/9780203702444,Book Link

Whitney","This paper investigates whether search engines and other new modes of online communication should be covered by free speech principles. It criticizes the analogical reasoning that contemporary American courts and scholars have used to liken search engines to newspapers, and to extend free speech coverage to them based on that likeness. There are dissimilarities between search engines and newspapers that undermine the key analogy, and also rival analogies that can be drawn which don’t recommend free speech protection for search engines. Partly on these bases, we argue that an analogical approach to questions of free speech coverage is of limited use in this context. Credible verdicts about how free speech principles should apply to new modes of online communication require us to re-excavate the normative foundations of free speech. This method for deciding free speech coverage suggests that only a subset of search engine outputs and similar online communication should receive special protection against government regulation.",Search-Engines.pdf,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/free-speech-in-the-digital-age-9780190883607?cc=gb&lang=en&,Book Link
academic,Reconciling Regulation with Scientific Autonomy in Dual-use Research,Forthcoming in Journal of Medicine and Philosophy // with Nicholas G. Evans and Michael J. Selgelid,"In debates over the regulation of communication related to dual-use research, we have to weigh the risks that such communication creates, against the value of scientific autonomy. The censorship of such communication seems justifiable in certain cases, given the potentially catastrophic applications of some dual-use research. But this conclusion gives rise to another kind of danger: that regulators will use overly simplistic cost-benefit reasoning to rationalise excessive regulation of scientific research. In response to this, we show how institutional design principles and normative frameworks from free speech theory can be used to help extend the argument for regulating dangerous dual-use research beyond overly simplistic cost-benefit reasoning, but without reverting to an implausibly absolutist view of scientific autonomy.",Reconciling-Regulation.pdf,,
academic,"Regulating Offense, Nurturing Offense","Politics, Philosophy, and Economics 17/3 (2018): 235-56","Joel Feinberg’s Offense to Others is the most comprehensive contemporary work on the significance of offense in a liberal legal system. Feinberg argues that being offended can impair a person’s liberty, much like a nuisance, and that it is therefore legitimate in principle to regulate conduct because of its offensiveness. In this paper I discuss some overlooked considerations that give us reason to resist Feinberg’s conclusion, even while granting this premise. My key claim is that the regulation of offense can inadvertently increase the incidence of offense, by nurturing offense-taking sensibilities. In the course of defending this claim and spelling out its implications, I explain why concerns about the inadvertent nurturing of offense are now more pressing, given the identity-political character of contemporary offense-based social conflicts, and I discuss why a reluctance to legally regulate offensive conduct need not be insensitive to the identity-political issues that animate those conflicts.",Regulating-Offense.pdf,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1470594X17741228,Journal Link

Some critics of this view argue that it condones, as rationally acceptable, sets of attitudes that manifest an untenable kind of arbitrariness. I begin by providing a new and more detailed explication of what this alleged arbitrariness consists in. I then explain why Miriam Schoenfield’s prima facie promising attempt to answer the Arbitrariness Objection, by appealing to the role of epistemic standards in rational belief formation, fails to resolve the problem. Schoenfield’s strategy is, however, a useful one, and I go on to explain how an alternative form of the standards-based approach to Permissivism – one that emphasizes the significance of the relationship between people’s cognitive abilities and the epistemic standards that they employ – can respond to the arbitrariness objection.",Permissivism.pdf,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/permissivism-and-the-arbitrariness-objection/4623130173707A94B11A4AC4103B9C06,Journal Link

Heinze's project is to formulate and defend a more theoretically complex version of the idea (also defended by people like Ronald Dworkin and James Weinstein) that general legal prohibitions on hate speech in public discourse compromises the state's democratic legitimacy. We offer a detailed synopsis of Heinze's view, highlighting some of its distinctive qualities and strengths. We then develop a critical response to this view with three main focal points: (1) the characterisation of democratic legitimacy as something distinct from (and whose demands aren't identical with those of) legitimacy per se; (2) the claim that the requirements of democracy are hypothetical, rather than categorical, imperatives; and relatedly (3) the question of how we should reconcile the requirements of democratic legitimacy with the costs that may follow from prioritising democratic legitimacy.

The significance of such ‘Etiological Challenges’ is a topic that has started attracting attention in epistemology. Current work on this topic aims to show that Etiological Challenges are, at most, only indirectly epistemically significant, insofar as they bring other generic epistemic considerations to the agent’s attention (e.g. disagreement, consistency with one’s own epistemic standards, evidence of one’s fallibility). Against this approach, we argue that Etiological Challenges are epistemically significant in a more direct and more distinctive way. An Etiological Challenge prompts the agent to assess whether her beliefs result from practices of indoctrination, and whether she should reduce confidence in those beliefs, given the anti-reliability of indoctrination as a method of belief-acquisition. Our analysis also draws attention to some of the ways in which epistemic concerns interact with political issues – e.g. relating to epistemic injustice, identity-based discrimination, and segregation – when we’re thinking about the contingent causal origins of our beliefs.",Indoctrination-Anxiety.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-015-0919-6,Journal Link

We explain why conceiving of such reasons as epistemic reasons can avoid this and other intuitively unwelcome results. We also suggest a positive case for conceiving of such reasons as epistemic reasons, namely, that they exhibit a kind of interpersonal normative parity that's typical of epistemic reasons but not pragmatic reasons.

I argue that much free speech discourse comes with a tacit commitment to a ‘Subtractive Approach’ to defining speech. As an initial default, all communicative acts are assumed to qualify as speech, before exceptions are made to ‘subtract’ those acts that don’t warrant the special legal protections owed to ‘speech’. I examine how different versions of the Subtractive Approach operate, and criticise them in terms of their ability to yield a substantive definition of speech which covers all and only those forms of communicative action that – so our arguments for free speech indicate – really do merit special legal protection. In exploring alternative definitional approaches, I argue that what ultimately compromises definitional adequacy in this arena is a theoretical commitment to the significance of a single unified class of privileged communicative acts.

Here I examine Murrow and Murrow‘s suggestions about how identity-based hate speech bears responsibility for dehumanization in the first place. I identify a distinction between (i) accounts of the nature of the harm effected by identity prejudice, and (ii) accounts of how hate speech contributes to the harms of identity prejudice. I then explain why Murrow and Murrow‘s proposal is more aptly construed as an account of type (i), and explain why accounts of this type, even if they‘re plausible and evidentially well-supported, have limited implications in relation to justifications for anti-hate speech law.",Dehumanization.pdf,https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/3/1/178/1751232,Journal Link

The reasons for this relate to Paul Kahn’s claims about the paradox of riskless warfare. When an Underdog poses no threat to a Superpower, the standard just war theoretic justifications for the Superpower’s combatants using lethal violence against their opponents breaks down. Therefore, Kahn argues, combatants in that position must approach their opponents in an ethical guise relevantly similar to ‘policing’. I argue that the kind of disparities in risk and threat between opposing combatants that Kahn’s analysis posits, don’t obtain in the context of face-to-face combat, in the way they would need to in order to support his ethical conclusions about policing.

These analyses look beyond the first-order hurts and disadvantages suffered by the immediate targets of hate speech, and consider the prospect of hate speech sustaining complex social structures whose wide-scale operations lower the social status of members of targeted groups. In Heyman’s and Waldron’s accounts we find plausible insights into the nature of identity-based social hierarchies, and the harms that redound to subordinated people under the operations of such hierarchies. I argue, however, that both analyses are unsuccessful as justifications for the restriction of hate speech, because they do not ultimately provide reason to think that hate speech is responsible for creating or sustaining identity-based social hierarchies.",Dignity-Harm.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10982-012-9164-z,Journal Link

How should we distinguish between the two kinds of cases, and thereby account for our divergent intuitions about how we ought to respond to them? One possibility is to say that ceding ground in a trivial dispute is appropriate because the disputing parties are usually epistemic peers within the relevant domain, whereas in a more substantial disagreement the disputing parties rarely, if ever, qualify as epistemic peers, and so ‘sticking to one’s guns’ is usually the appropriate doxastic response.

After mapping out these relations, I consider what becomes of them once we acknowledge the significant limitations in people’s capacity for intellectual self-governance. I argue that acknowledging these limitations undermines the putative justifications for free speech that I outlined in the first part of the paper.

Speech can effect identity-based oppression, McGowan argues, by altering the ""conversational score"" – i.e. by introducing presuppositions and expectations into a conversation, and thus determining what sort of subsequent conversational ‘moves’ are felicitous – in a manner that oppresses members of a certain group, e.g. because the suppositions demean that group. In keeping with the Lewisian picture, McGowan notes the asymmetric pliability of conversational scores. For example, it is easier to introduce sexist presuppositions into a conversation, she argues, than it is to remove them. Responding to a sexist remark is thus like trying to ""unring a bell"". After explaining how McGowan's account of oppressive speech improves upon the work of others, in its explication of the relation between speech and structural oppression, I then propose a supportive elaboration of her claims about the asymmetric pliability of conversations involving identity-oppressive speech. We can understand this asymmetry as a consequence of a more general asymmetry between making things salient and un-salient in speech.

Further, we claim that the structure of the decision-making process around life-extension is unlikely to be the way that it would need to be in order for Agar’s claims about fear of death to make sense.

Riskless warfare creates ethical problems that the superpower state must grapple with, in trying to determine whether and how it can justly engage in military conflicts involving profound military-technological disparities. But riskless warfare isn’t an ethical problem from the point of view of the individual soldier in the superpower’s military, insofar as that soldier’s life remains under threat from opposing soldiers. The significance of enhanced battlesuit technology is that these risks to individual soldiers may become greatly mitigated, or even, in various cases, eliminated, which would in turn problematise the superpower soldier’s justification for attacking the underdog soldier with lethal force, in a way that broadly resembles the ‘paradox of riskless warfare’ that applies at the level of the state.

In Richard Swinburne’s writings on theodicy, however, we find two arguments that may be offered in opposition to this prevailing view. In this paper, these two arguments – the argument from usefulness and the argument from assumed consent – are explained and evaluated. I suggest that both of these arguments are ineffective, because of their failure to distinguish between the different ways in which persons may be of-use in the attainment of some good state of affairs.",Avoiding-Afterlife.pdf,https://forumphilosophicum.ignatianum.edu.pl/1522-avoiding-the-afterlife-in-theodicy-victims-of-suffering-and-the-argument-from-usefulness.html,Journal Link
other,"Speaking Freely, Thinking Aloud, and Embarrassing Yourself on Social Media","ABC Religion & Ethics, 7th of May 2020","Why do we care about free speech? One theory says that being able to speak freely to others is a necessary condition for us realising our capacities as thinking beings. Why do we care about privacy? One theory says that our interest in privacy is about cordoning off a ""drafting space"" in which we can rehearse our opinions and our self-presentational choices, to see what we like and what we want to revise, before publicising these parts of our identity. In this paper I draw on these theories to explain an unhappy feature of social media discourse. We’re drawn to share our ideas on social media because it seems like a valuable forum for speaking freely with others and thereby realising our capacities qua thinking beings. But we mistakenly treat social media as if it is a private conversation – a suitable drafting space for our public identities – when it is functionally anything but.",Thinking-Aloud.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/religion/thinking-aloud-free-speech-and-embarrassing-on-social-media/12217326,Web Link

other,Weaponisation,"New Statesman, 11th of February 2020","It is increasingly common today, in political debate, for people to accuse their opponents of weaponising an ideal or value. For example, progressives accuse conservatives of weaponising free speech, and conservatives accuse progressives of weaponising compassion. In this piece I criticise this sort of rhetorical brinkmanship. I argue that an aversion to ""weaponisation-talk"" is not merely a symptom of a naively conflict-avoidant liberal mindset, i.e. the kind of mindset that’s criticised by agonistic realists. Instead, I suggest that weaponisation-talk is to be resisted because it encourages us to move from a justified frustration about the benighted or disingenuous invocation of some ideal, towards an unjustified sense of antipathy or suspicion about the ideal itself.",Weaponisation.pdf,https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/02/how-rhetoric-weaponisation-undermining-liberal-ideals,Web Link
other,"Book Review // ""The Varieties of Religious Expedience"": Review of Interior States, by Megan O'Gieblyn","The New Rambler Review, 5th of February 2020","This is a review of a collection of literary essays centred around two themes: (i) Christianity and post-Christian culture, and (ii) the American Midwest. I offer a synopsis of some of the key essays, and identify some argumentative ""through-lines"" that link the essays across the two themes. The collection’s distinguishing merit, I argue, is that way that it models the difference between two kinds of intellectual-cum-political attitudes: awareness and perspective. Where the former tends to favour simplifying explanations of social phenomena, the latter tends to favour subtler, more complex, and ultimately more explanatorily conscientious (if less satisfying) explanations. O’Gieblyn’s essays argue for the importance of perspective, in how we understand Christianity’s role in American public life, and demonstrate in practice what perspective in this topical area looks like.",Religious-Expedience.pdf,https://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/religion/the-varieties-of-religious-expedience,Web Link

In my review I present a fairly sympathetic summary of the book's arguments. But I then put a little bit of critical pressure on them. In particular, I challenge Whittington's suggestion that the political polarisation that's occuring on campuses, and the resultant challenges for the university's commitment to free speech, stem from a kind of left-wing intolerance of conservative ideas.",Speak-Freely.pdf,https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/triggered-speak-freely/,Web Link

While the collection includes essays from proponents of a wide range of theoretical and methodological perspectives, I suggest in my review that the collection's overall function is to serve as a kind of demonstrative rejoinder to those philosophers, like Raz, who argue that we can and should theorise human rights without trying to furnish them with philosophical foundations.",Foundations-Human-Rights.pdf,https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/16/4/article-p517_517.xml,Journal Link

Primarily, I challenge the claim that having a free speech culture on campus conduces to the realisation of the university's epistemic aims. I defend a conception of the university which is defined by its commitment to academic standards, and on which resistance to ideological conformity, groupthink etc. is understood as being grounded in the ideals of academic freedom specifically, in contrast to a more generic principle of free speech.",Universities-Democracy.pdf,http://justice-everywhere.org/democracy/universities-and-democratic-legitimacy-part-1/,Web Link

The main reason to refrain from platforming such speakers isn't that their speech is harmful or offensive, as proponents of no-platforming often argue, but rather that platforming trolls and provocateurs fails to promote, and in various situations is likely to inhibit or undermine, the achievement of the university's defining intellectual aims.",Silencing-Milo.pdf,,

I try to identify points of common ground between the Buddhist doctrine of right speech, and the Western ethical-political ideal of freedom of speech. I suggest that it is possible for freedom of speech to be theorised and understood in a way that isn't just shallowly individualistic, but which bears more of a resemblance to Buddhist ideas about society and the good life – that is to say, which takes free and open communication to be elements of a way of life that ultimately conduces to social harmony and people's emancipation from selfish ways.",White-Lies.pdf,,

It summarises the theological ideas that Lewis explores through the work, before developing a kind of moral critique of the literary and rhetorical methods that Lewis uses, in the text, to put forward those ideas. That critique is then situated within a broader analysis of Lewis’s life and worldview, and some suggestive commentary on Lewis’s position and influence within post-war Christian culture. The discussion is dotted with the author’s first-personal account of his own feelings about the work, and the impact it has had on him.",Lewis-Demons.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/religion/cs-lewiss-demons/10094768,Web Link

I explain why the idea of technologically boosting the general public's pro-social dispositions, in the hope of increasing people's willingness to modify their behaviour to reduce their contributions to climate – a proposal entertained by some advocates of 'moral bioenhancement' – is unlikely to succeed. It's unlikely to succeed because it's premised on a faulty understanding of how human cooperation works. Human cooperation relies on an equilibrium of pro-social and anti-social dispositions. Simply boosting people's pro-sociality runs the risk of disrupting that equilibrium in a way that in fact makes mass coordainted cooperative behaviour less likely.",,https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2016/08/25/making-humans-morally-better-wont-fix-the-problems-of-climate-change/,Web Link

Both books are concerned with the question of whether we should try to live as morally good a life as possible. MacAskill thinks the answer is 'yes', and his book is an overview of how the Effective Altruist movement approaches the problem of how to achieve a morally optimal life. MacFarquhar's book is a more descriptive account of the lives of people who aim to live in a morally optimal way. Her discussion is nuanced, and somewhat ambivalent about the merits of this aim.

Our question is how we should understand what's going on, epistemologically speaking, when someone says to another person something like ""you only believe in God because you were raised in a religious household"". Does the drawing of attention to the arbitrary causal origins of some person's beliefs represent a good reason for the person in question to reduce her confidence in the relevant beliefs? Yes, we argue, in those cases where the point of the challenge is to advert to the possibility that the person was indoctrinated into those beliefs.
